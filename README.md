# Metaballs and Marching Cubes
This project store Metaballs data into ply files and visual them with Marching Cubes algorithm.
## How to generator data
The dataset is on the /DataSets/Metaballs folder, the learnply program will also read datasets from that folder. /
Inside the folder, there is a python file call metaball_ply_genrator.py, this is a script for generator metaballs datasets. /
