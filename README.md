# Metaballs and Marching Cubes
This project store Metaballs data into ply files and visual them with Marching Cubes algorithm.
## How to generator data
The dataset is on the /DataSets/Metaballs folder, the learnply program will also read datasets from that folder. \
Inside the folder, there is a python file call metaball_ply_genrator.py, this is a script for generator metaballs datasets. 
## How to run the visual program
Run the .sln file inside the /learnply folder in visual studio \
Hotkeys: \
1: classify points\
2: visualize metaballs with pre set threshold\
3: animated metaballs with decreasing threshold\
m: set the minimum threshold in the animation\
f: freeze the animation\
n: switch to next dataset
